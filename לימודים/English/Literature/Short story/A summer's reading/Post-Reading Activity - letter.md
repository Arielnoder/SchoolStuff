# Post-Reading Activity - letter

Dear Mr. Cattanzara,

How are you? 

I am writing this letter to let you how I have been  doing in the past 10 years. 

 I am sorry for not writing you sooner. I have just been so busy with my new job as a writer for the New York Times,

that I only just now managed to get thanks to you.  You taught me respect, gave me confidence, and most most of all

 you made me the  man I am today.

 Without you I would have never turned my life around. 



I heard you opened your own library, thats great! I will make sure to visit it if 

I ever come to town again.

Till then take care of yourself and the town.



Yours 

George
