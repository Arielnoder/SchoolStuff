## 1. Write a letter of apology.......

Dear Grandmother,

Hello, How are you doing? I am writing this letter to apologize for the way I acted toward you in the past.

I am sincerely sorry for not giving you the attention and love you deserve. 



I did it for my own selfish reasons too, meeting with friends,going to the movies or playing

 video games on my computer. 



But don't worry I am going to  make this up to you, I am going to visit you more often, call you on my free time,

or even write you more letters like this one.



By the way, Are you coming to town anytime soon? If you are, 

let me know so we could meet.



Hope to see you soon! 



Sincerely,

your Granddaughter
